PORT configuration setting is used to specify the port number on which Strapi application will listen for incoming HTTP requests.

API_TOKEN_SALT is an environment variable used as part of the security measures for generating and validating API tokens.

ADMIN_JWT_SECRET is an environment variable used in Strapi for securing the administrative authentication and authorization system. Strapi is a content management system (CMS) that allows users to create, manage, and publish content, and the admin panel is where administrators or content managers interact with the system.

TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT is an environment variable used to enhance the security of token generation and validation processes in applications. It is similar in purpose to the API_TOKEN_SALT, but it's specifically related to transfer tokens.

DATABASE_CLIENT is an environment variable used to specify the type or client of the database management system (DBMS) that Strapi application will use for data storage.

DATABASE_FILENAME is an environment variable used to specify the filename and path for the SQLite database when SQLite is chosen as the database client
